- âœ… **Business impact tracking** (time to first PRD, AI acceptance rates)
- âœ… **Performance monitoring** (real-time sync, collaboration metrics)
- âœ… **Cost optimization analytics** for AI usage

### **6. Technical Stack Optimization**
- âœ… **Updated technical stack** for MVP-first approach
- âœ… **Vite + React** instead of Next.js for faster development
- âœ… **Simplified real-time collaboration** (Operational Transforms â†’ CRDT later)
- âœ… **Direct AI integration** before LangChain complexity

### **7. Implementation Roadmap**
- âœ… **Detailed implementation roadmap** (`docs/implementation/roadmap-with-risk-mitigation.md`)
- âœ… **Risk assessment framework** with automated monitoring
- âœ… **Phased delivery strategy** with clear success criteria
- âœ… **Contingency plans** for technical and resource risks

## ðŸ”§ **Key Technical Decisions Made**

### **MVP Simplifications**
- **Real-time Editing**: Start with Operational Transforms, upgrade to CRDT in Phase 2
- **AI Integration**: Direct API calls first, LangChain orchestration later
- **Frontend Build**: Vite for development speed over Next.js complexity

### **Risk Mitigation Strategies**
- **AI Cost Management**: Usage tracking, prompt optimization, rate limiting
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Local storage backup, conflict detection, auto-save reliability
- **Collaboration Conflicts**: Server-authoritative resolution with user notification

### **Security Implementations**
- **PII Protection**: Automated detection in AI prompts before processing
- **API Security**: Automatic key rotation, rate limiting, breach detection
- **Data Encryption**: Application-level encryption for sensitive integration configs

## ðŸ“Š **Success Metrics Established**

### **User Engagement KPIs**
- Time to first PRD creation: Target **15 minutes**
- AI suggestion acceptance rate: Target **65%**
- Collaboration session duration: Target **45 minutes** average

### **Technical Performance KPIs**
- Real-time sync latency: Target **< 200ms**
- AI response start time: Target **< 3 seconds**
- System uptime: Target **99.9%**

### **Business Impact KPIs**
- PRD creation time reduction: Target **50%** vs manual process
- Cost per PRD with AI assistance: Target **< $2.00**
- User satisfaction (NPS): Target **> 50**
